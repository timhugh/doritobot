# doritobot

Discord server specifically built to control The Walking Dorito Project Zomboid server hosted on Bisect Hosting (but should work for anything!)

# Usage

**TODO -- this is a rough draft**

Set environment variables:
```
DISCORD_APP_ID=<your bot application's ID>
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=<generate an Oauth token for the bot in Discord developer console>
BISECT_API_URL=https://games.bisecthosting.com/
BISECT_API_TOKEN=<generate an API token on Bisect Hosting>
BISECT_SERVER_ID=<ID of the server you want to control>
```
